### Description
Construct an Administrator Dashboard desktop interface utilising the CSS Grid. The primary goal of this project was to enhance comprehension of the grid system for generating intricate layout designs.


### Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS


### Thoughts and Observations

This project offered an opportunity to delve extensively into the CSS Grid. Although combining Flexbox with Grid could potentially result in a more responsive design, the project's specifications explicitly necessitated maximizing the use of CSS Grid.

I began constructing the code by employing a CSS normalize file as the groundwork. By incorporating my own custom CSS variables and adopting the BEM naming methodology, I  created code that is more maintainable and readable compared to my previous projects.
